    <h1>How to remove red wine stains from cotton</h1>

    <div class="card answer">
      <p><strong>Best first move:</strong> blot the stain, flush from the back with cold water, then treat with a detergent solution. If a tint remains, use an oxygen-based bleach (color-safe) and wash as warm as the care label allows.</p>
      <p class="meta">Works best on fresh stains. For dried stains, see notes below.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Step-by-step</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Blot (don’t rub):</strong> press with a clean cloth or paper towel to absorb as much wine as possible.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold rinse from the back:</strong> run cold water through the fabric from the underside to push wine out, not deeper in.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre-treat:</strong> apply a small amount of liquid laundry detergent (or a mild dishwashing liquid) and gently work it in.</li>
      <li><strong>Wait:</strong> let it sit for 5–10 minutes. Keep the area damp; don’t let it dry.</li>
      <li><strong>Rinse and check:</strong> rinse with cold water and reassess. Repeat pre-treatment if needed.</li>
      <li><strong>De-tint (if needed):</strong> soak in oxygen-based bleach solution per product directions (often 30–60 minutes).</li>
      <li><strong>Wash:</strong> wash with a heavy-duty detergent at the warmest temperature the care label allows.</li>
      <li><strong>Air-dry first:</strong> heat from a dryer can set remaining discoloration. Only tumble dry once the stain is gone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What not to do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t rub aggressively — it spreads the stain and roughens fibers.</li>
      <li>Don’t use hot water first — it can make the stain harder to remove.</li>
      <li>Don’t put it in the dryer until you’re sure the stain is gone.</li>
      <li>Don’t use chlorine bleach on colored cotton unless the label explicitly allows it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notes for dried stains</h2>
    <p>If the stain has dried, start with a 15–30 minute soak in cool water with detergent, then follow the steps above. You may need multiple cycles. Patience usually beats harsh chemicals, especially on dyed fabrics.</p>
